## Five interconnected aspects
1. The dots will connect close to each other. The line breaks when the distance is too far.

2. The mouse controls a dot and connects when it is close to other dots.

3. The color of the line changes depending on the distance between the dots.

4. Music is played when a mouse dot is connected to other dots.

5. There are raindrops on the canvas, and the raindrops move at different speeds.

6. Get hand movements from the camera. Raindrops pause when you make a fist. Releasing the hands will resume.
